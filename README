AsciiPanel.as
---------

Heavily inspired by the Java AsciiPanel from Trystan: https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel

To quote the README of the original AsciiPanel:

AsciiPanel simulates a code page 437 ASCII terminal display. It supports all
256 characters of codepage 437, arbitrary foreground colors, arbitrary
background colors, and arbitrary terminal sizes.

The default terminal size is 80x24 characters and default colors matching the
Windows Command Prompt are provided.

This should be useful to roguelike developers.
